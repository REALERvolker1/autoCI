# autoCI
A package manager for all those pesky portable apps!

## to install...

requires node.js 17+

I am making this on njs 18 but 17 supports fetch and Octocat and you might be ok with that but idk tbh
```
pnpm i -g pnpm
git clone https://github.com/REALERvolker1/autoCI
cd autoCI
pnpm i
pnpm run c
```

Currently very bare-bones, code is posted here for review.

If you get ratelimited, uncomment the token auth in the Octocat initialization and add a github PAT to the config.
